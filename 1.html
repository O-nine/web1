    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html5-20100624/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard Markup
    language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web aplications.
    <p>HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation.</p>
    <p>These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet.
    <br>It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.
    <br>It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the
    <br>» W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.</p>
